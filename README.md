# ToDoList-Project

This project contains the HTML code for a simple webpage that includes a Bootstrap button for deleting an item. The page also includes the necessary links to Bootstrap CSS, jQuery, Popper JS, andstrap JS. Additionally, there is a custom JS file linked at the end.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can simply copy and paste the HTML code into an HTML file. Then, save the file with a .html extension and open it in a web browser.

You will also need to download and link to the necessary Bootstrap and JS files. You can do this by adding the following links to your HTML file:

Bootstrap CSS: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css

jQuery: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js

Popper JS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.16.6/dist/umd/popper.min.js

Bootstrap JS: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js

You can also link to your own custom JS file, as shown in the example code.

## Using the Delete Button
The delete button in this project is a standard Bootstrap button with the class "btn btn-danger". You can use this button as a template for creating your own delete buttons.

To use the delete button, you will need to add some custom JavaScript to handle the delete functionality. This can be done by adding an event listener to the button, as shown in the example custom JS file.

Here is an example of how to add an event listener to the delete button:

### Copy code
const deleteButton = document.querySelector('.btn-danger');

deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Delete functionality goes here
});
You can then add your own delete functionality inside the event listener.
